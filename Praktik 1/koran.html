        <h4 class="bold-text">WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h4>
        <p>Lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
            popularised in the 1960s with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem
            ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            aldus pagemaker including versions of lorem ipsum.
        </p>
        <h4 class="bold-text">WHY DO WE USE IT?</h4>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
            content of a page when lookin g at its layout. The point of using lorem ipsum
            is that it has a more -or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
            'content here, content here', making it look like readable english. Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like) .
        </p>
        <h4 class="bold-text">WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?</h4>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, lorem ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
            in a piece of classical latin literature from 45 bc, making it over 2000 years
            old. Richard mcclintock, a latin professor at hampden -sydney college in
            virginia, looked up one of the more obscure latin words, consectetur, from a
            15
            lorem ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem ipsum comes from
            sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de fin ibus bonorum et malorum" (the
            extremes of good and evil) by cicero, written in 45 bc. This book is a treatise
            on the theory of ethics, very popular during the renaissance. The first line of
            lorem ipsum, "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
            1.10.32.

        <p>There are many variations of
            passages of lorem ipsum available,
            but the majority have suffered
            alteration in some form, by injected
            humour, or randomised words which
            don't look even slightly believable.
            If you are going to use a passage of
            lorem ipsum, you need to be sure
            there isn't anything embarrassing
            hidden in the middle of tex t.
            All the lorem ipsum generators on
            the internet tend to repeat
            predefined chunks as necessary,
            making this the first true generator
            on the internet. It uses a dictionary
            of over 200 latin words, combined
            with a handful of model sentence
            structures, to generate lorem ipsum
            which looks reasonable. The
            generated lorem ipsum is therefore
            always free from repetition, injected
            humour, or non-characteristic words
            etc.

            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quia ea sit animi maiores placeat aliquid, mollitia ex. Non eos quidem illum, officiis voluptates, deserunt autem natus sequi error ratione ipsa.
